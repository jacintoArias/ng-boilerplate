# jarias's NgBoilerplate

This is intented to be a very opinionated Angular app boilerplate from which I quickstart most of my project. It is biased towards my own personal preference and opinions which are in fact ~~stolen~~ inspired by many other experienced and awesome developers.

This is still an ongoing work, I will update this readme with further information once I feel it is stable enough!

Feel free to criticise and give advice!
